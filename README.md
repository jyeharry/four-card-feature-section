## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Refreshed my memory on CSS Grid. It was a little tricky getting it right. I wanted to try to make the columns responsive without breakpoints but learnt that when your grid items are using `grid-row` and `grid-column`, the trick with using `repeat(auto-fit, ...)` doesn't work. I'm satisfied with my result but would like to know if there is a better way to do it.

### Continued development

I'd like to master grid so that I can create layouts whose CSS is easy to read and understand, ideally without too many media queries because I feel as though this is where things can start to get messy when you have lots of them.
